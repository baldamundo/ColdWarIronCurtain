 #Subs, Torpedoes
 #Small Torpedoes
 ww_submarines:0 "WW2 Era Submarines"
 ww_submarines_desc:0 "WW2 era submarines were crude compared to more modern variants. Many of them needed to stay above water for extended periods of time before submerging because of the difficulty they had storing and acquiring air. Submarines play a primarily offensive role in naval combat using torpedoes to take out enemy ships and are also used to take down poorly defended transport ships. Although basic, WWII era submarines can still fill this crucially important naval role and are better than not having submarines altogether."
 torpedo_ww:0 "WW2 Torpedoes"
 torpedo_ww_desc:0 "WW2 era torpedoes were anti-ship torpedoes comparable to light torpedoes in modern navies. During the Cold War, torpedoes were exclusively used in submarines, so there are no upgrades available for this outdated WW2 era ship torpedo module."
 torpedo_small_0:0 "Small Torpedoes I"
 torpedo_small_0_desc:0 "Early post war torpedoes followed most of the design principles of late war torpedoes including electric engines and contact detonation with gyroscope guidance. However, post-war torpedoes would also include newer components including passive cruise sonar. In addition to improvements to guidance and the addition of homing, they also had greater damaging capability and massively extended ranges, depths, and speeds."
 torpedo_small_1:0 "Small Torpedoes II"
 torpedo_small_1_desc:0 "Following the early designs and improving them, later small torpedoes began to include greater technology such as active doppler homing and better warheads for explosives. These torpedoes also featured optimized propellers for greater agility and speed and modern materials that could allow them to be deployed at largely greater depths. This flexibility and agility allow submarines to take up more optimal or hidden positions and attack in areas more difficult for the enemy to defend from or plan around."
 torpedo_small_2:0 "Small Torpedoes III"
 torpedo_small_2_desc:0 "Continuing to make improvements to torpedo technology, torpedoes around this era were completely redesigned and replaced most of the doctrines from WWII era torpedoes. Improved torpedoes include pump jets and swash-plate piston engines with monopropellant fuels. In addition to this, warheads were improved with more capable explosives and proximity fuses. These torpedoes are also improved by adding better active guidance systems to aid them in actively seeking and engaging targets. It should also be noted that torpedoes in this era began to adopt lighter metals or alloys wherever they could get away with it allowing them to be lighter and stronger than ever before."
 torpedo_small_3:0 "Small Torpedoes IV"
 torpedo_small_3_desc:0 "Modern torpedoes featured better acoustics, electronics, and materials. These modern torpedoes can even circle back in the event of a miss and attempt another attack if they have the fuel. Additionally, the better acoustics and electronics can greatly reduce the number of first chance misses. All of these improvements together allow for torpedoes to reach new heights of lethality."
 torpedo_small_4:0 "Small Torpedoes V"
 torpedo_small_4_desc:0 "With the new century comes new technologies and new challenges for torpedoes to face. The countermeasures, defenses, and improved materials of the modern era have lent themselves to the need for better guidance systems, more speed, and higher explosives. CBASS (Common Broadband and Advanced Sonar System) technology enables advanced torpedoes to engage targets much further away. Optimizations in structural integrity and propulsion systems allow them to be used at greater depths. These submarines can also monitor surrounding electrical and magnetic fields to enabled high-precision detonation fuses and allow for active guidance to hit ships in preferred locations."
 
 #Large Torpedoes
 torpedo_large_0:0 "Large Torpedoes I"
 torpedo_large_0_desc:0 "By simply upgrading the quantity of explosives and increasing the size of the guidance systems and engines in torpedoes, you can greatly increase their firepower. This does, however, require the development of a better structure and extended engine system to carry the increase in weight. Various improvements to these fields enabled the development of larger and more powerful torpedoes post-war."
 torpedo_large_1:0 "Large Torpedoes II"
 torpedo_large_1_desc:0 "While large ships began to fall out of favor with most navies, including some navies giving up heavy/battlecruisers altogether in favor of more numerous, harder to hit cruisers, the need for more powerful torpedoes did not end. Greater levels of anti-sub technology and sub detection technology created the need for longer range torpedoes. The easiest solution is to simply create larger torpedoes that can hold more fuel and have stronger engines to go further and hit their targets from farther away. This does, however, place a greater level of weight on the need for better guidance systems and long-range submarine targeting capability making the problem more complex than simply having a bigger torpedo."
 torpedo_large_2:0 "Large Torpedoes III"
 torpedo_large_2_desc:0 "The new doctrines and routes taken in torpedo designs make previous methods for upgunning torpedoes obsolete. Increasing the size of swash-plat piston engines and pump jets is not as easy in the confines of a torpedo as it is on a ship. A lot of the rear structures of the torpedo needed to be modernized and redesigned. However, due to new technologies, this was easier to create than former heavyweight torpedoes."
 torpedo_large_3:0 "Large Torpedoes IV"
 torpedo_large_3_desc:0 "One of the key improvements made to develop modern torpedoes was the ability to circle back for another shot at a missed enemy. In order to equip heavyweight torpedoes with this capability, the structure had to be lighter and the engines had to be updated."

 #SLBM
 slbm_tube_1:0 "SLBM Tube I"
 slbm_tube_1_desc:0 "The early SLBM tube was basic and the earliest designs had very limited capacity. Early SLBM tubes were based off the torpedo tube with heavy modifications made to accommodate the new weapon. However, most of the cost of developing submarine systems capable of launching nuclear weapons was in the extensive electronics systems necessary for targeting and aiming the missile rather than holding it themselves. Despite the incredible investment and foundations needed to develop the SLBM tube, submarines had very limited range and targeting capability due to the primitive nature of early electronics."
 slbm_tube_2:0 "SLBM Tube II"
 slbm_tube_2_desc:0 "While early SLBM tubes had serious problems due to the limits of the technology at the time, improvements to computing technology greatly enabled submarines to hold far better targeting and aiming systems for SLBMs and also miniaturized the size of the on-board systems which could allow for more SLBM tubes or other systems.\nDue to the limits of HOI4 and the format of the module designer, this improved design increases SLBM capacity assuming the saved space goes toward increasing the number of tubes."
 slbm_tube_3:0 "SLBM Tube III"
 slbm_tube_3_desc:0 "Further improvements to the technology of SLBM tubes paved the way for even greater ranges and targeting capability. Recent advances in computing and electronics allows for better systems in the control of SLBMs"
 slbm_tube_4:0 "SLBM Tube IV"
 slbm_tube_4_desc:0 "Modern SLBM systems are capable of interoperability between the strategic network of a nation and the nuclear submarine network on a level unimagined before. Additionally, modern SLBM systems can allow nuclear submarines to target regions with extreme precision at incredibly long ranges. In combination with modern SLBMs, modern SLBM systems could allow nuclear submarines to strike anywhere in the world and truly ensure mutual destruction even in the event of a first strike crippling retaliation capability."

 #Screen Modules
 rhib_launch_1:0 "RHIB Launch Facility I"
 rhib_launch_1_desc:0 "The RHIB is a boat with a rigid hull and inflatables. They can be used for a variety of operations including aiding a ship's patrols, provide aid for work efforts, transport troops, and be used as lifeboats. The earliest RHIB boats had limited uses and capacities compared to later designs, although this is owed almost entirely to indirect development efforts such as material research and small equipment benefits. Nonetheless, RHIB boats can be used to aid in naval patrols, maritime security, reducing accidents and repairing the ship if it has problems, and several other tasks."
 rhib_launch_2:0 "RHIB Launch Facility II"
 rhib_launch_2_desc:0 "Modernizing the RHIB with modern materials and indirect improvements made in other fields greatly improves their capacity and allows for a greater level of flexibility. However, there also need to be improvements to the RHIB launch itself including better facilities for retrieval and deployment, maintenance equipment, and the standardization of the deck itself."
 rhib_launch_3:0 "RHIB Launch Facility III"
 rhib_launch_3_desc:0 "Further improving RHIBs with modern equipment and auxiliaries can greatly aid in interoperability between RHIBs and the ship itself. Additionally, including wheelhouses alongside these auxiliaries can improve patrol efficiency."
 rhib_launch_4:0 "RHIB Launch Facility IV"
 rhib_launch_4_desc:0 "An advanced RHIB center fully equipped with RHIBs for a multitude of missions and purposes to greatly reduce ship accidents and aid in patrols."
 screen_aviation_1:0 "Screen Aviation I"
 screen_aviation_1_desc:0 "ASW helicopters are large helicopters that carry ASW missiles used for taking down submarines. These helicopters can help protect ships against submarines and move faster than either the ship or the submarine can. Outfitting platforms with a basic helipad and arming them with an ASW helicopter and its maintenance crew can greatly improve a ship's anti-submarine capability."
 screen_aviation_2:0 "Screen Aviation II"
 screen_aviation_2_desc:0 "While having a basic platform and a ASW helicopter is simple and effective, it isn't enough to meet the needs of the modern army. Equipping a screen aviation facility with additional spare parts and all the equipment necessary to maintain the helicopter for an extended period while out at sea is necessary to ensure continuous, safe operations and continue the ship's protection against submarines."
 screen_aviation_3:0 "Screen Aviation III"
 screen_aviation_3_desc:0 "Outfitting the screen aviation platform with auxiliaries and equipment to mount more modern helicopters is expensive but necessary in order to hold said modern helicopters."
 screen_aviation_4:0 "Screen Aviation IV"
 screen_aviation_4_desc:0 "Modern screen aviation platforms come equipped with highly advanced electronic and mission control systems to aid interoperability between the helicopter and the ship. When combined with this modern equipment, ASW helicopters can achieve high levels of mission efficiency and protect their craft from submarines."

The term refers specifically to magnetometers used by military forces to detect submarines (a mass of ferromagnetic material creates a detectable disturbance in the magnetic field)."
 maritime_sonar_2:0 "Hybrid Magnetostrictive-piezoelectric Transducer Sonar"
 maritime_sonar_2_short:0 "Advanced Sonar"
 maritime_sonar_2_desc:0 "In the 1970s, compounds of rare earths and iron were discovered with superior magnetomechanic properties, namely the Terfenol-D alloy. This made possible new designs, e.g. a hybrid magnetostrictive-piezoelectric transducer. The most recent of these improved magnetostrictive materials is Galfenol."
 maritime_sonar_3:0 "Global Sonar Surveillance System"
 maritime_sonar_3_short:0 "Global Sonar Surveillance System"
 maritime_sonar_3_desc:0 "GSSS is a network of hydrophone arrays mounted on the seafloor throughout the Atlantic and Pacific oceans like with The SOSUS system it takes advantage of the sound channel that exists in the ocean, which allows low-frequency sound to travel great distances. This channel is called the SOund Fixing And Ranging, or SOFAR."

 conventional_sub_engines_0:0 "WW2 Submarine Engines"
 conventional_sub_engines_0_short:0 "WW2 Sub Engines"
 conventional_sub_engines_0_desc:0 "Most early submarines used a direct mechanical connection between the combustion engine and propeller, switching between diesel engines for surface running and electric motors for submerged propulsion. This was effectively a "parallel" type of hybrid, since the motor and engine were coupled to the same shaft."

 conventional_sub_engines_1:0 "Improved Submarine Engines"
 conventional_sub_engines_1_short:0 "Improved Sub Engines"
 conventional_sub_engines_1_desc:0 "A true diesel-electric transmission arrangement, by contrast, the propeller or propellers are always driven directly or through reduction gears by one or more electric motors, while one or more diesel generators provide electric energy for charging the batteries and driving the motors."

 conventional_sub_engines_2:0 "Advanced Submarine Engines"
 conventional_sub_engines_2_short:0 "Advanced Sub Engines"
 conventional_sub_engines_2_desc:0 "This technology uses a submarine diesel engine which can be operated conventionally on the surface, but which can also be provided with oxidant, usually stored as liquid oxygen, when submerged. Since the metal of an engine would burn in pure oxygen, the oxygen is usually diluted with recycled exhaust gas. Argon replaces exhaust gas when the engine is started."

 conventional_sub_engines_3:0 "Stirling Submarine Engines"
 conventional_sub_engines_3_short:0 "Stirling Sub Engines"
 conventional_sub_engines_3_desc:0 "A Stirling engine is a heat engine that is operated by the cyclic compression and expansion of air or other gas (the working fluid) at different temperatures, resulting in a net conversion of heat energy to mechanical work. More specifically, the Stirling engine is a closed-cycle regenerative heat engine with a permanent gaseous working fluid. Closed-cycle, in this context, means a thermodynamic system in which the working fluid is permanently contained within the system."

 conventional_sub_engines_4:0 "Pump-jet Submarine Engines"
 conventional_sub_engines_4_short:0 "Pump-jet Sub Engines"
 conventional_sub_engines_4_desc:0 "Toward the end of the 20th century, some submarines, such as the British Vanguard-class began to be fitted with pump-jet propulsors instead of propellers. Though these are heavier, more expensive, and less efficient than a propeller, they are significantly quieter, providing an important tactical advantage."

 nuclear_sub_engines_0:0 "Early Nuclear Submarine Engines"
 nuclear_sub_engines_0_short:0 "Early Nuclear Sub Engines"
 nuclear_sub_engines_0_desc:0 "An early Submarine Thermal Reactor or STR, also known as the S2W reactor in US Navy service is a pressurized water reactor. Nuclear power has the crucial advantage in submarine propulsion because it is a zero-emission process that consumes no air. This means that a submarine outfitted with such a reactor could theoretically stay submerged indefinitly."

 nuclear_sub_engines_1:0 "Improved Nuclear Submarine Engines"
 nuclear_sub_engines_1_short:0 "Improved Nuclear Sub Engines"
 nuclear_sub_engines_1_desc:0 "Nuclear power has revolutionized the submarine, finally making it a true "underwater" vessel, rather than a "submersible" craft, which could only stay underwater for limited periods. It gave the submarine the ability to operate submerged at high speeds, comparable to those of surface vessels, for unlimited periods, dependent only on the endurance of its crew."

 nuclear_sub_engines_2:0 "Modern Nuclear Submarine Engines"
 nuclear_sub_engines_2_short:0 "Modern Nuclear Sub Engines"
 nuclear_sub_engines_2_desc:0 "A pressurized water reactor (PWR) is a type of light-water nuclear reactor. PWRs constitute the large majority of the world's nuclear power plants (with notable exceptions being the UK, Japan and Canada). In a PWR, the primary coolant (water) is pumped under high pressure to the reactor core where it is heated by the energy released by the fission of atoms. The heated, high pressure water then flows to a steam generator, where it transfers its thermal energy to lower pressure water of a secondary system where steam is generated."

 sub_batteries_2_short:0 "Hydrogen Sub Batteries"
 sub_batteries_2_desc:0 "Although hydrogen–oxygen propulsion had been considered for submarines as early as World War I, the concept was not very successful. This has been countered by storing the fuel and oxidizer in tanks outside the crew space, between the pressure hull and outer light hull. The gases are piped through the pressure hull to the fuel cells as needed to generate electricity, but at any given time there is only a very small amount of gas present in the crew space."
