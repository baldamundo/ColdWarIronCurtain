 som.1.d:0 "The execution of Barre has taken place just moments ago in the capital Mogadishu. He was brought to the central market place, where he was hanged for his attempted coup against the nation. This will send a strong message to those who think they can just do whatever they want."
 som.2.d:0 "Yesterday evening, the execution of Siad Barre took place in the capital Mogadishu. According to witness records, he was brought in, dragged to the stand and quickly executed by hanging. The hanging however was done incorrectly, leading him to suffer for several minutes. According to the new government, this will set an example of what happens to those who think they can take on the government."
 som.3.d:0 "Just moments ago a respected army general Siad Barre led a bloodless takeover of Somalia's government. Somali troops supported by tanks under the command of Barre stormed Mogadishu and seized key government buildings and ordered the resignation of the country's leaders. The coup deposed the current president. The motive is the assassination of Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke earlier."
 somnews.1.d:0 "The United Nations passed a controversial decision, giving Italy the trusteeship over its former colony Somaliland. The territory has been under British military control since 1941 and its forces are due to hand over responsibility to Italian authorities. Despite criticism at seemingly returning a colonial possession, a UN official noted both Somali independence and Italian officials agreed on independence within ten years. The UN also requires Italy provide regular, public reports on its efforts at developing and preparing Somaliland for independence. Many Italians welcome the decision, seeing it as an opportunity for Italy to complete its responsibility of preparing its former colonies for independence. Most Somalis are hopeful, though many will wait to see before openly supporting the Italian trusteeship."

 som.4.d:0 "The UN's objective of providing independence within 10 years for the people of Somaliland was finally fulfilled with the Italian Somaliland gaining independence from Italy today. The newly formed Somaliland simultaneously united with British Somaliland, which gained their own independence just a few days before. The unification immediately brought the Somali Republic into existence, with a government forming by Abdullahi Issa and Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal along with other members of the trusteeship and protectorate governments, with Haji Bashir Ismail Yusuf as President of the Somali National Assembly, Aden Abdullah Osman Daar as President of the Somali Republic, and Abdirashid Ali Shermarke as Prime Minister. However, the UN's rushed push for the 10 year independence was exposed of its downside as the republic appears to still be under heavy colonial influence both amongst the people and the government. For now, the fate of the land of Somalia relies upon the republic."
