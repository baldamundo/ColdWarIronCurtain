 Dem_1980_Primary.1.d:0 "To the excitement of many Democrats, Senator Ted Kennedy announced he would challenge President Jimmy Carter in the Democratic primaries to represent the party for the upcoming Presidential Elections. The decision to challenge an incumbent President certainly has few parallels in American political history. The Senator made the decision after consulting with his family. Analysts note that Kennedy believes his family legacy and mystique will decisively overcome whatever incumbent advantage President Carter possesses. A source close to Kennedy noted the Senator had no confidence in how President Carter was governing, noting his poor approval rating."
 Dem_1980_Primary.2.d:0 "Senator Ted Kennedy and his top advisors are holding discussions on how to approach media. All recognize it will be a difficult challenge to defeat an incumbent President. The first challenge is an upcoming interview with respected CBS political reporter Ted Mudd. The interview will occur three days before the candidacy. All agree the Senator must continue to build anticipation to maximize excitement among democrats in the lead up to the official announcement. The Senator and key staff members are inclined to use the interview as a way to tease the electorate, setting up the nation for the official announcement. However, other advisors suggest the Senator use the interview to lay out his agenda and perspective, to demonstrate presidential decisiveness. However, doing so may weaken the historical impact of the official announcement. After intense discussion a decision was reached…"
 Dem_1980_Primary.3.d:0 "The interview of Senator Ted Kennedy by respected CBS reporter Ted Mudd became a disaster for the presidential hopeful. When the journalist pressed the Senator on why he wanted to be President, Ted Kennedy appeared uncomfortable and repetitive. The Senator also appeared unprepared when asked about the notorious Chappaquiddick incident. Critics noted Senator Kennedy answered questions rather vaguely. Polls taken after the interview show a sharp decline in popularity for the Senator as many Americans do not recognize him as a proper inheritor of the Kennedy mystique. Privately, advisors to the Senator admit the interview did not go as planned and efforts to use the interview to build anticipation for the official announcement did not translate to the public."

The official announcement by Senator Kennedy is expected to occur in the coming days."
 Dem_1980_Primary.5.d:0 "The President Jimmy Carter started the 1980 Democratic primary campaign with a resounding victory in the Iowa caucuses.

Analysts note the victory gives the President legitimacy and momentum before the next set of primary contests. Analysts note Senator Kennedy has struggled to capture the imagination of democratic voters, due to lackluster appearances. Many establishment democrats have also shown an inclination to support President Carter, believing the party cannot lose the advantage of incumbent.

Both sides will clearly continue to campaign aggressively against each other."
 Dem_1980_Primary.6.d:0 "Senator Ted Kennedy was announced the winner of the Iowa caucuses, starting off the Democratic primary campaign with an opening victory. The defeat of President Carter will shake his support, especially among establishment Democrats as his incumbent status failed to counter the challenge of the fiery Massachusetts Senator.

Both sides will clearly continue to campaign aggressively against each other."

 Dem_1980_Primary.9.d:0 "As Democratic Party leaders and delegates arrive in New York City for the Democratic National Convention, the eyes of the nation will be upon them. The convention is expected to be contested with both incumbent President Jimmy Carter and challenger Senator Ted Kennedy fighting for the Presidential nomination. Senator Kennedy launched an aggressive campaign during the primary season, leading to bitter campaigning between him and President Carter.

 Dem_1980_Primary.10.d:0 "News from Madison Square Garden confirms that President Jimmy Carter has won the nomination of the Democratic Party for President of the United States. This ends a difficult primary campaign in which the incumbent faced a spirited challenge from Senator Ted Kennedy. It is not clear yet if the Senator has congratulated the President. Democratic Party leaders will now hope the party can now rally behind President Carter as they look forward to what will undoubtably be a bitter campaign against the Republican nominee. The President thanked the delegates and urged party supporters to now come together."
 Dem_1980_Primary.11.d:0 "Senator Ted Kennedy gave his concession speech to the Democratic National Convention in Madison Square Garden. It is being received as the greatest speech of his career. Kennedy gave an unapologetic, nostalgic defense of post-war liberalism, government programs, and called for a national health insurance program. Noting even if programs were inefficient, the "ideal of fairness always endures." He criticized the Republican vision and congratulated President Jimmy Carter. He concluded the speech by quoting a poem beloved by his revered elder siblings, ending with the memorable phrase, "the dream shall never die." The crowd interrupted with applause over fifty times. Despite the powerful address, critics did note Senator Kennedy did not give a strong endorsement of President Carter and implicitly criticized his moderate views. It appears the Democratic Party will remain conflicted on how deeply it embraces its liberal values."

During the difficult primary campaign, Kennedy managed to rally Democratic support over his embrace of liberal values. Political experts see the victory of Kennedy as the defeat of moderate Democratic power over the party. President Carter, graciously conceded, though privately, close advisors say he is stunned by the defeat. Democratic leaders are now using the convention to establish a united front in preparation for the national campaign. It is clear the 1980 election will be a cultural battle between liberalism and conservatism."
