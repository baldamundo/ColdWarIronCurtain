 India_Emergency.21.d:0 "Parliament voted to approve the forty second amendment to the constitution, representing a major victory for the Prime Minister. The bill reduces the power of the judiciary, especially with regards to election results and determining the validity of legislation. The office of the Prime Minister has also received new powers. The Preamble of the constitution was also changed, with the description of India changed from “sovereign democratic republic” to “sovereign, socialist, secular democratic republic.” The addition of socialist and secular reflects the emphasis on national unity and ensuring the nation work to resolve economic inequalities. The opposition is strongly criticizing the new amendment, calling it an illegal attempt to legitimize the undemocratic emergency policies of the Prime Minister. The government has dismissed the criticism, noting the amendment was passed according to constitutional procedure."
