 space_race_decision_event.1.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader][ROOT.GetName] Launches Unmanned Array into Space"
 space_race_decision_event.1.d:0 "Following extensive investment in a nationalized space program, [ROOT.GetLeader] announced the successful launch of an unmanned array into Earth's orbit.\nWith the recent overtures from both the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics towards heavy investment in their respective space programs, it is clear the emerging global space race has spurred on nations from across the world to engage in the research and development of space faring technology and science.\nWhile the success of the current program might seem rudimentary in nature, clearly this is only the beginning of a new entry in the global space race, with more investment in the [Root.GetAdjective] space program all but assured for the future!\n\n(on your marks...)"
 space_race_decision_event.1.a:0 "This is amazing"
 space_race_decision_event.2.t:0 "[GetNewspaperHeader][ROOT.GetName] Launches Animal into Space"
 space_race_decision_event.2.d:0 "After the recent success of the [Root.GetAdjective] Space Program in previous years, [ROOT.GetLeader] has upped the ante of [ROOT.GetName]'s role in the global space race with the announcement of the successful launch of a live animal into Earth's orbit.\nFollowing a brief fear concerning the plight of the animal, the aspiring cosmonaut was successfully recovered after its vessel landed safely off the coast of the Mediterranean, following a successful 9 hour flight mission in Earth's orbit.\nThis moment marks a significant victory in the [Root.GetAdjective] Space Program; with continued investment in the national space program, it might not be long before the next great step for [ROOT.GetName] in the global technological race.\n\n(...Get Set...)"
